Prompt #1
I'm designing a personal website to showcase my portfolio projects for a web development course. Generate the HTML structure for a single-page layout that includes a hero section, bio section, skills section with icons, projects section, and contact section with a submit button. Keep the code simple using only HTML and CSS as I am a beginner and want to edit it myself as I learn. Follow best practices for a clean, modern design.
